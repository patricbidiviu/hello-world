-	Download and Install GIT from here https://git-scm.com/download/win
-	Create a .gitconfig file with content similar to the attached .gitconfig file
-	Clone your repository (e.g git clone repo/path.git location/path)
-	ALWAYS work on a separate branch (also called feature branch), NEVER work directly on the master branch.
-	Create a new branch and switch to it (git checkout -b newBranchName)
	Usually the branch is named using the following style: featureName-IUser
